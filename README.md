## 💡 Inspiration

Reconciliation is often a complex and time-consuming process, requiring business users to handle extensive manual tasks that are not only labor-intensive but also highly prone to errors. This inefficiency can lead to delays in identifying discrepancies, impacting decision-making and overall productivity. Automating reconciliation streamlines the workflow, reduces the chances of human error, and saves significant time and effort for the business team. By leveraging advanced technology, automation ensures accuracy, efficiency, and a more reliable reconciliation process, empowering teams to focus on strategic initiatives rather than repetitive manual corrections.
